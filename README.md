# tech4u-website
Website for tech4u non-profit. To be replaced with a new one soon that is under development at the moment.

Programming For All. TECH4U is a non-profit run by high-schoolers who are passionate stem-advocates. We decided to take advantage of this hackathon and create an interactive website for our non-profit. We have already taught over 128 children and hope to keep teaching underprivileged children. 
WE also encourage any of your donations.
